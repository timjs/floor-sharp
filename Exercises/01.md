1. Given the function `double`:

  ```fsharp
  let double x = x + x
  > val double : int -> int
  ```

  give two possible derivations of the term `double (double 2)`, i.e:

  * one expanding the inner `double` first,
  * another expanding the outer `double` first.


2. Recall the definition of `sum`:

  ```fsharp
  let rec sum xs =
    match xs with
    | [] -> 0
    | n :: ns -> n + sum ns
  > val sum : int list -> int
  ```

  * Define a function `product` of type `int list -> int`
  that produces the product of a list of integers.
  * Check your definition using `fsharpi`.
  * Using your definition to show that `product [2; 3; 4] == 24`.
  (Recall that `[2; 3; 4]` is syntactic sugar for `2 :: 3 :: 4 :: []`,
  where `::` is the infix cons operator.)


3. What are the types of the following values?

  * `['a'; 'b'; 'c']`
  * `('a', 'b', 'c')`
  * `[(1, 2); (3, 4)]`
  * `([1; 2], [3; 4])`
  * `[sum; product]`

  Check your answers using `fsharpi`.


4. Write down definitions that have the following types.
  It does not matter what the definitions actually do,
  as long as they are type correct.

  * `bools : bool list`
  * `nums : int list list`
  * `add : int -> int -> int -> int`
  * `copy : 'a -> 'a * 'a`
  * `apply : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b`

  Check your answers using `fsharpi`.


5. What are the types of the following functions?

  * `let swap (x, y) = (y, x)`
  * `let pair x y = (x, y)`
  * `let double x = x * 2`
  * `let twice f x = f (f x)`

  Check your answers using `fsharpi`.
