Introduction

   Note: all code examples are show as if entered in F# Interactive (``fsharpi``).
   The last line starting with a ``>`` contains the response from F# after typing
   ``;;`` and hitting return (enter).

1. Given the function ``double``:

.. code:: fsharp

   let double x = x + x
   > val double : int -> int

give two possible derivations of the term ``double (double 2)``, i.e:

A. one expanding the inner ``double`` first,
B. another expanding the outer ``double`` first.

2. Recall the definition of ``sum``:

.. code:: fsharp

   let rec sum xs =
     match xs with
     | [] -> 0
     | n :: ns -> n + sum ns
   > val sum : int list -> int

-  Define a function ``product`` of type ``int list -> int``
   that produces the product of a list of integers.
-  Check your definition using ``fsharpi``.
-  Using your definition to show that ``product [2; 3; 4] == 24``.
   (Recall that ``[2; 3; 4]`` is syntactic sugar for ``2 :: 3 :: 4 :: []``,
   where ``::`` is the infix cons operator.)

3. What are the types of the following values?

-  ``['a'; 'b'; 'c']``
-  ``('a', 'b', 'c')``
-  ``[(false, '0'); (true, '1')]``
-  ``([false; '0'], [true; '1'])``
-  ``[sum; product]``

4. Write down definitions that have the following types;
   it does not matter what the definitions actually do,
   as long as they are type correct.

-  ``bools : bool list``
-  ``nums : int int list``
-  ``add : int -> int -> int -> int``
-  ``copy : 'a -> 'a * 'a``
-  ``apply : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b``

5. What are the types of the following functions?

-  ``swap (x, y) = (y, x)``
-  ``pair x y = (x, y)``
-  ``double x = x * 2``
-  ``twice f x = f (f x)``

6. Check your answers to the preceding three questions using ``fsharpi``.
